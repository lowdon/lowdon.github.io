    I've added a new project to the "My Projects" entry on this website with a new project I just finished. It was good fun working on the graphics + physics, and I think I've learned a lot. Good progress I'd say! Check it out! :)

            So it seems that I have updated once again the design of this website. Still inching ever closer to the desired outcome. Major inspirations for the design of this site come from the legendary <a style="margin: 0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand">Paul Rand</a>, master of graphic design. I strongly recommend everyone to check some of his work out!
            <br>I have also begun studying more on computer graphics and have been enjoying it. Check out the Oscilloscope project on the "My Projects" link down below.
            <br><br>Lastly I leave you with some history on the International Typographic Style, for further reading: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Typographic_Style">Link</a>

            Well, this is it. The website is finally out! It took a while to work out some of its quirks, but it's here. There's still a lot of things to be taken care of but everything needs to start somewhere. Let's see where it goes...
