        <p>
            My name is Francisco Costa and currently I am a Computer Science student at Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia from Universidade Nova de Lisboa.
            <br> My interests are mainly in the field of automation, A.I., computer vision and cryptography.
            <br> Outside these fields, I also have interests in history, arts (especially music), having composed some tracks that are publically available, and philosophy, having founded a philosophy club in high school.
            <br> All pictures on this website were taken by me on a Pentax analog camera using black and white film. All rights reserved.
